# .NET-Core-Chat-App-using-WebSockets
Chat app made with C#, .NET Core and WebSockets.

Tools i used for client app:
-HTML, JS
Tools i used for server app:
-WebSockets
-NET Core
-DependencyInjection
-LINQ (almost none)...
and more

Point of this Chat app was to teach myself basics of internet communication.
Using Middleware, async methods and more i was able to understand more about terms like pipeline, Request Delegates, 
WebSockets, Asynchronus Programming, Client&Server communication, Threading and Middleware Build
